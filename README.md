# Assessment2_Q3_COMP1010
Q3.2: [9 points] Write a function matrix_multiplication(A, B) which takes as input
matrices A and B, and outputs/returns a matrix equal to AB.
Q3.3: [5 points] Write a function trace(A) which takes as input matrix A, and outputs/returns
the sum of the main diagonal elements of A.
Q3.4: [5 points] In the main body of your program (the main() function), initialize matrices
Aa, Ab, and Ac, which correspond to the graphs in Q3.1(a), Q3.1(b), and Q3.1(c) respectively.
For each matrix A, print out the value of trace(A3)/6. Compare the number of three-edge
triangles in the graph with the respective value of trace(A3)/6.
